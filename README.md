# 💬 Social Media Sentiment Analysis

This project performs sentiment analysis on social media text data to classify user opinions as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. It can be used to track public opinion on brands, products, services, or events in real time.

## 📌 Objective

To build a machine learning pipeline that:

* Preprocesses raw social media text data
* Extracts features using NLP techniques
* Trains models to classify sentiment
* Evaluates model performance with standard metrics

## 🧠 Techniques Used

* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Text cleaning & preprocessing
* TF-IDF vectorization
* Machine Learning Classification (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, etc.)
* Model evaluation (confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall)

## 🧰 Tools & Libraries

* Python 🐍
* Jupyter Notebook 📓
* Pandas, NumPy
* NLTK, Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib, Seaborn

## 📁 Files Included

* `Social Media Sentiment Analysis.ipynb`: Main notebook with full workflow
* `README.md`: Project overview and documentation

## 🔍 Key Steps

1. **Data Collection**: Import dataset (e.g., tweets or social media posts)
2. **Data Preprocessing**:

   * Remove noise (punctuation, stopwords, URLs, etc.)
   * Tokenization & Lemmatization
3. **Feature Extraction**: TF-IDF Vectorizer
4. **Model Training**:

   * Logistic Regression
   * Naive Bayes
   * Support Vector Machines (SVM)
5. **Evaluation**: Classification report and visual metrics

## 📊 Model Performance (Sample)

| Model               | Accuracy |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | \~80%    |
| Naive Bayes         | \~90%    |
| SVM                 | \~90%    |

*Replace `XX%` with actual values from your notebook.*

## ▶️ How to Run

1. Clone the repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shlndra/social-media-sentiment-analysis.git
   cd social-media-sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Social\ Media\ Sentiment\ Analysis.ipynb
   ```

## 🚀 Future Improvements

* Deploy as a web app using Streamlit or Flask
* Integrate real-time Twitter or Reddit API
* Use deep learning models (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
